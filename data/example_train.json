    "instruction": "Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs. Examples include classification and regression. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction."
